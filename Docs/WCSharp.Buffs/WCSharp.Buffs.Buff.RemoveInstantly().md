## Buff.RemoveInstantly() Method

Will instantly remove this buff from the unit, including calling [OnDispose()](WCSharp.Buffs.Buff.OnDispose().md 'WCSharp.Buffs.Buff.OnDispose()') and any other relevant steps.  
  
It's recommended to just set [Active](WCSharp.Buffs.Buff.Active.md 'WCSharp.Buffs.Buff.Active') to false unless the removal should not be delayed for some reason.

```csharp
public void RemoveInstantly();
```
