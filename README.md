# WCSharp
This is a set of libraries designed to assist in the WarCraft III mapmaking using C#.
Development of the C#-to-Lua transpilation that WCSharp depends on can be followed in [this thread](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/c-mapmaking-in-csharp.317839/).
A quick setup/template for getting a map with WCSharp up and running can be found [here](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki/WCSharp-template).

For those not using the template, all of WCSharp is available via NuGet packages.

For information on the individual systems provided by these libraries, please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki)!

Feel free to report bugs, make suggestions or request features!
