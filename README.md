# WCSharp
This is a set of libraries designed to assist in the WarCraft III mapmaking using C#.
Development of the C#-to-Lua transpilation that WCSharp depends on can be followed in [this thread](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/c-mapmaking-in-csharp.317839/).

### Getting started
A quick setup/template for getting a map with WCSharp up and running can be found [here](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki/WCSharp-template).  
For those not using the template, all of WCSharp is available via NuGet packages.

### API
The WCSharp API has recently launched, serving as a replacement and upgrade to War3Api. To find out more, [check the wiki page about it](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki/WCSharp.Api).

### Documentation
Information on the individual systems provided by these libraries can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki)!  
There you can also find the [release notes](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki/Release-notes) that have been logged since v2.1.0.

In addition to the wiki, WCSharp is extensively documented via Visual Studio's built-in XML documentation, allowing you to simply hover over references to get detailed information. Thanks to [Default Documentation](https://github.com/Doraku/DefaultDocumentation)'s automatic generation, [the entire documentation can also be seen on GitHub itself](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/tree/master/Docs/README.md).
